A heavy work in progress, cross-platform, godot-based replacement for Valve's Hammer Editor for Source

Created because of the issues regular hammer has that can't be fixed due to it's closed source nature.

Current features:
- 3D camera controls restriced to a 3d view
- Basic UI elements
- Ability to create a cube at the press of a button
- Basic VTF Support
<br>
<h2 align="center"> Requirements </h2>

Hardware requirements:
- GLES3/OpenGL 3.3+ Supported hardware
<br>
<br>

Development requirements:
- a C# supporting IDE
- Godot v3.x (>=3.4.4)
- VTFLib.dll (For VTFLibWrapper)

<br>
<h1 align="center"> Note for Contributions </h1>
Everything that needs to be recreated from Source must be done without any actual Source Engine code. If that's not possible don't bother with the feature. We're trying to not get on Valve's bad side here.

This project is written in C#. The only GDScript files that remain haven't been converted yet.
