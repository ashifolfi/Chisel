# Chisel
A heavy work in progress, cross-platform, godot-based replacement for Valve's Hammer Editor for Source

Created because of the issues regular hammer has that can't be fixed due to it's closed source nature.

Current features:
- 3D camera controls restriced to a 3d view
- Basic UI elements
- Ability to create a cube at the press of a button

# Note for Contributions
Everything that needs to be recreated from source must be done without any actual Source Engine code. If that's not possible don't bother with the feature.

C# script contributions are not allowed. Scripts must be written in GDScript as I do not have a C# environment setup for godot
